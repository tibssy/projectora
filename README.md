# Projectora ðŸ‘»

**Projectora** is an interactive web app that lets you project Rive animations on your windows for Halloween (or any event!). Users can control animations in real-time using their camera for example, making pumpkin eyes follow their nose or ghosts react to hand gestures.

Built with:
- **React + Vite**
- **Tailwind CSS** with **Catppuccin Mocha** theme
- **Rive Web Canvas** for animations
- **MediaPipe** for camera-based interactivity
